# Project Details:

# Identify 20 deadly diseases of Apple, Grape, Maize, Potato and Tomato using convolutional neural networks (CNN), transfer learning and multilevel classifications. 
   
# The git will show you: 

# Batch Processing Pipeline: How to process millions of images to train your model.

# Transfer Learning Strategy: How to use transfer learning to develop your AI model to solve advanced computer vision problems.

# Multilevel Classificaiton: A classic example/practical step by step guide for multi-level classifications.
 
# How to use:  MobileNetV2, ResNet50V2, ResNet101V2, ResNet152V2, Xception, VGG16, VGG19, InceptionResNetV2 and InceptionV3

# Assess the top layer accuracy of: MobileNetV2, ResNet50V2, ResNet101V2, ResNet152V2, Xception, VGG16, VGG19, InceptionResNetV2 and InceptionV3 to find the best one.
